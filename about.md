<p>Hi there,<br>
I'm Zoe—great to meet you!</p>

<p>I'm a fourth-year student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Human Geography with a minor in GIS and Environmental Studies. My passion lies in urban issues, especially improving the quality of life for marginalized communities in cities. This focus began during my Urban Studies at Concordia University.</p>

<p>On my projects page, you'll find ongoing and upcoming projects related to urban marginalization. Additionally, I’m independently developing data skills, including data engineering—currently pursuing the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate on Coursera—and exploring machine learning techniques to work with urban datasets in the future.</p>
