      <h3 class="map-subtitle">Categorizing Taxi Trip Start Points by Spatial Patterns in Porto</h3>
      <t>This map visualizes the start points of 10,001 taxi trips in the city of Porto, categorizing them into three distinct spatial patterns: widespread, clustered, and scattered. The color-coded representation helps distinguish these patterns, where blue dots indicate widespread start points, yellow represents clusters, and red highlights scattered points. The map provides a clear view of the spatial distribution of taxi trips throughout the week, offering insights into how taxi activity is distributed across different areas of Porto.</t>
