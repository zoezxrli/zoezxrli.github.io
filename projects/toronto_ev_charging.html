    <h3 class="map-subtitle">Project Summary</h3>
    <div class="project-summary-text">
        <p>As Toronto accelerates toward its Net-Zero by 2040 goals, access to public EV charging remains highly uneven across the city — particularly in low-income, high-density, and transit-oriented communities. This solo project, developed for the 2025 Esri Canada App Challenge, investigates spatial disparities in EV charging availability using a multi-criteria demand index across 585 census tracts.</p>
        <p>Through a dual-interface deployment — a public-facing StoryMap and a planner-focused Experience Builder App — this project supports equitable transportation planning by revealing where policy, infrastructure, and socioeconomic stressors collide. The final map enables decision-makers to explore high-demand, underserved zones and download tract-level data for planning and grant support.</p>
      <h4>Key Insights</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>60%+ of high-demand zones</strong> are concentrated in apartment-dense neighborhoods where residents lack access to at-home chargers, which posing major equity concerns.</li>
        <li><strong>30+ GO Train stations</strong> across Toronto are located in charging deserts, lacking public EV infrastructure within 500 meters, despite high commuter traffic.</li>
        <li>Areas with <strong>both high EV ownership and low charger access</strong> (e.g., Scarborough, North York) highlight critical mismatches in deployment strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Transit-adjacent employment zones</strong> where long-distance commuters or rideshare drivers park. This shows demand for workplace charging that is not currently met.</li>
        <li>The tool enables <strong>layered filtering</strong> of EV demand factors (housing, income, proximity) to help cities <strong>prioritize investment in the most infrastructure-poor neighborhoods</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Methods</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>EV Demand Score:</strong> Developed a composite index using 6 weighted variables:
          <ul>
            <li>Proximity to underserved GO Train stations (+3 points)</li>
            <li>Absence of public EV chargers (+3 points)</li>
            <li>High percentage of low-income residents (LIM-AT) (+2 points if >20%)</li>
            <li>High apartment density (5+ stories, where home charging is unavailable) (up to +4 points)</li>
            <li>High EV ownership levels (up to +4 points)</li>
            <li>Employment hubs (job centers requiring workplace chargers) (+2 points)</li>
          </ul>
          Assigned a final EV Demand Score to each census tract, classifying areas into low (0-4), medium (5-7), and high (8+) demand zones.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Proximity Analysis:</strong> 500m buffer around GO Train stations to detect charger gaps.</li>
        <li><strong>Spatial Join:</strong> Allocated FSA-level EV ownership and employment zone data to census tracts.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer Classification:</strong> Natural Breaks (Jenks) and Quantile for thematic visualization.</li>
        <li><strong>UX Design:</strong> Experience Builder allows layer toggling, filtering, and data export (GeoJSON/CSV).</li>
      </ul>
