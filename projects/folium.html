        <h3>Categorizing Taxi Trip Start Points</h3>
        <p>This map visualizes the start points of 10,001 taxi trips in the city of Porto, categorizing them into three distinct spatial patterns: widespread, clustered, and scattered. The color-coded representation helps distinguish these patterns, where blue dots indicate widespread start points, yellow represents clusters, and red highlights scattered points. The map provides a clear view of the spatial distribution of taxi trips throughout the week, offering insights into how taxi activity is distributed across different areas of Porto.</p>

      <h3>Monday Taxi Trips (6 AM – 9 PM)</h3>
      <p>This map visualizes the extracted taxi trip data from Monday, between 6 AM and 9 PM, filtered using a lambda function to isolate the relevant time range. Both the start and end locations of the trips are displayed on an interactive Folium map. By focusing on this specific time window, the map offers a clear and detailed view of taxi movement patterns during the selected hours in the city of Porto.</p>

      <h3>Traffic Volume and Key Routes at 9 AM</h3>
      <p>This map visualizes traffic volumes during the 9 AM peak hour, focusing on identifying areas of high congestion and heavy traffic flow. Using Matplotlib, frequently used routes are highlighted, providing a detailed representation of the city’s traffic patterns at this critical time. This visualization pinpoints key corridors and intersections where traffic is most concentrated, offering valuable insights into urban mobility and transportation dynamics in Porto.</p>
