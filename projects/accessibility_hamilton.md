  <h3 class="map-subtitle">Introduction</h3>
  <div class="description">
      <d>Hamilton, Ontario, has a notably high proportion of seniors compared to other regions in the province. Residents aged 65 and older account for 18.3% of Hamilton’s population, slightly below Ontario’s 18.5% but higher than Toronto’s 17.1%. Among these, seniors aged 85 and older represent 2.6% of Hamilton’s population, aligning with provincial and Toronto averages. This aging population highlights the increasing importance of addressing the unique challenges seniors face in the city.</d>

      >
      At the same time, Hamilton is seeing a significant rise in housing costs. Over the past decade, rental rates have climbed by 55%, far exceeding the 22% rise in the overall cost of living. Seniors, particularly those with fixed incomes from pensions or government assistance, are especially vulnerable to these escalating costs. Many are being forced to relocate from central, high-cost neighborhoods to more affordable areas on the city’s outskirts.<br><br>
      While moving to less expensive neighborhoods may reduce financial strain, it often leads to new obstacles. Affordable areas typically have fewer healthcare facilities, including pharmacies and long-term care homes. This poses a significant challenge for seniors, especially those living with dementia, who depend on proximity to these essential services. Additionally, public services, including transit infrastructure, are often concentrated in the city core. Seniors living farther away may struggle with longer travel times and reduced access to care.<br><br>
      This story map explores how rising housing prices in Hamilton are displacing low-income seniors and how this displacement affects their access to critical dementia care services. By examining housing trends, mapping vulnerable populations, and analyzing accessibility challenges, the goal is to provide a clearer understanding of these issues and inform potential solutions.

  <h3 class="map-subtitle">Step 2: Mapping Senior Renters and Vulnerable Wards</h3>
  <div class="description">
      <d>
      Hamilton’s rental affordability crisis has pushed low-income seniors out of high-cost central wards, such as Wards 1, 2, and 3, into more affordable but underserved areas like Wards 11, 12, and 15. Using a Senior Renters Proxy—a combination of senior population percentages and renter proportions—we identified areas with high concentrations of senior renters.<br></d>
      <d>Key Visualizations:</d>
      <d>Unaffordability Rates (2016 vs. 2021): These maps highlight how central wards have become increasingly unaffordable, with wards like 1, 2, and 3 experiencing steep price increases.</d>
      <img 
          class="map-image" 
          src="/assets/images/unaffordable_rate.jpg" 
          alt="accessibility_hamilton"
      >
      <br>
      <d>Senior Renters Proxy (2016 and 2021): These maps show how senior renters are increasingly concentrated in peripheral wards as they are displaced from unaffordable central areas.</d>

          src="/assets/images/senior_renter_proxy.jpg" 
          alt="accessibility_hamilton"
      >
      <br>
      <d>Vulnerability Scores (2016 and 2021): Overlaying unaffordability, senior populations, and rental dependency reveals which wards are most vulnerable, with high scores in wards like 11, 12, and 15.</d>
      <img 
          class="map-image" 
          src="/assets/images/vulnerable_score.jpg" 
          alt="accessibility_hamilton"
      >
      <br>
      <d>The maps reveal a strong correlation between increasing unaffordability and the displacement of senior renters to more vulnerable wards. These peripheral areas lack the healthcare and transit infrastructure necessary to meet the needs of aging populations, creating compounded risks for low-income seniors.

  <h3 class="map-subtitle">Step 3: Accessibility to Dementia Care Facilities</h3>
  <div class="description">
      <d>
      As seniors are displaced to more affordable wards, their access to critical healthcare services diminishes. Long-term care homes and dementia care facilities are disproportionately concentrated in central wards such as Wards 2 and 3, leaving peripheral wards like Wards 11 and 15 underserved. This relocation increases travel distances and times for seniors, creating additional barriers to care.
      <d>Key Visualizations:</d>
      <d>Long-Term Care Facilities Overlayed on Vulnerable Scores: This map shows how high-vulnerability wards, such as Wards 11 and 12, have limited access to long-term care facilities, leaving displaced seniors at a significant disadvantage.</d>
      <img 
          class="map-image" 
          src="/assets/images/long_term_care.jpg" 
          alt="accessibility_hamilton"
      >
      <br>
      <d>The maps illustrate the mismatch between high-vulnerability areas and the availability of long-term care facilities. Seniors in peripheral wards face longer travel times and reduced access to specialized dementia care, exacerbating health inequities. These findings highlight the need for better distribution of healthcare resources across the city.

  <h3 class="map-subtitle">Step 4: Transit Dependency and Mobility Challenges</h3>
  <div class="description">
      <d>
      Public transit plays a critical role in connecting seniors to healthcare facilities, yet its availability varies widely across Hamilton. Peripheral wards, such as 11, 12, and 15, have sparse bus stop distribution and limited transit routes, making it difficult for seniors to reach long-term care facilities and pharmacies. Displaced seniors, who are often reliant on public transportation, face significant mobility challenges in these areas.<br><br>
      Public Transit Accessibility Analysis<br>
      <d>Proximity to Long-Term Care Facilities: This map highlights the increased travel burden for seniors living in peripheral wards, where fewer healthcare resources are available.</d>
      <img 
          class="map-image" 
          src="/assets/images/bus.jpg" 
          alt="accessibility_hamilton"
      >
      <br>
      <d> The map reveals that transit infrastructure does not adequately support seniors in peripheral wards. For example, seniors in Wards 12 and 15 face longer and more complicated transit routes to reach healthcare facilities, increasing their reliance on community or family support. These gaps highlight the importance of enhancing public transit in underserved areas to ensure equitable access to essential services.

  <h3 class="map-subtitle">To Conclude</h3>
  <div class="description">
      <d>
      Hamilton’s rising housing costs are creating significant challenges for its aging population, particularly low-income senior renters. This analysis shows a clear pattern: seniors are being displaced from central wards, where rents have surged, to more affordable peripheral areas. However, these less expensive wards often lack the infrastructure and services needed to support seniors, creating new difficulties in their daily lives.<br>
      Displaced seniors face a range of challenges. Wards like 11, 12, and 15, while more affordable, have limited access to critical healthcare services, such as long-term care facilities and pharmacies. This results in longer travel distances and greater reliance on public transportation. For seniors with dementia, these barriers to care can lead to delays in receiving necessary treatment, worsening health outcomes and quality of life.<br>
      By expanding affordable housing options near essential services, improving transit infrastructure in affordable neighborhoods, and incentivizing the development of dementia care facilities, Hamilton can address these gaps. Ensuring that seniors—especially the most vulnerable—can age with dignity, independence, and access to care is essential for creating a more equitable and age-friendly city.<br>This research also reveals significant inequities in how healthcare and transit resources are distributed across Hamilton. Central wards, where rents have become increasingly unaffordable, remain hubs for healthcare facilities and transit networks. In contrast, peripheral wards with higher vulnerability scores lack the infrastructure needed to support the growing population of displaced seniors. This imbalance highlights systemic gaps that demand immediate attention.
